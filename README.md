This is our app BeSammen which is made for helping young people struggling with psoriasis. It is helping them by being able to talk to peers with Psoriasis as well. By creating such cummunity for them, they will be able to find support in each other, get tips & tricks to treatment options and other problematics that can help them in their everyday life.

To run this project you will need and IDE like Android Studios. It is very user friendly so you don't have to be tech savy.

If you wanna get a feeling of what this app can provide & and how to navigate it before downloading it you can try out figma, which is an exact wireframe of the project:
